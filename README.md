As a personal project in data scraping and data wrangling, I decided to write an R script to compile basic product information from the SAQ.com website using the rvest package. Included is the SAQ logo, R script, Rmarkdown pdf and CSV Dataset containing scraped information.

First applied on a single product, then on a single product page, then on all product pages.

Note that code was compiled based on information on SAQ.com on the 19th of July 2020 (product numbers, number of products on store succeptible to daily changes due to supply and demand managed by the SAQ.
